            <h2>Hi, it's me, Alanna!</h2>
            <p>I'm currently a studdent at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">thinkful</a>, living in Riverside California.  I'm enjoying learning about web design and plan to continue learning for years to come.</p>
            <p>I find efficiency, cleanliness, and order to be immensely satisfying, so coding has been a thrill thus far.</p>

            <div class="group">
            <div class="item item-2x">
            <p>I've always been interested in and comfortable with computers and technology, and am excited to move towards working with them as a career.  I also look forward to working with others as a team to complete large scale projects beyond an individual's scope.</p>            
            <p>I can remember writing rudimentary programs on a ti-84 calculator during art history class back in high school.  Good times.</p>
            <p>I realized fairly late in life, at 27, that I'm trans.  It's the best thing that's happened in my life, and gave me a new motivation for personal and professional growth.</p>
            <p>I've loved animals all my life, and after years having many pet rats, I now have two wonderful cats.</p>
